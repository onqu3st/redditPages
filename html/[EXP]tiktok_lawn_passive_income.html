“It doesn’t get dumber (or easier) than this: every morning while the coffee brews I take a 30-second video of my lawn. Same patch of grass, same ½-assed pan across the yard. I slap the day’s date on it in CapCut, title it ‘Lawn Check – Day 127’, and post it to a TikTok series. I added a cheap Amazon affiliate link to the sprinkler I use—because, why not—and put the playlist on Spotify in every clip so people can ‘watch grass grow’ while they work. After 200 videos the channel hit 50 k followers; I earned $137 in Creator Fund pennies and about $380 in affiliate commissions. Total ‘work’ so far: under three hours for the entire year.”
