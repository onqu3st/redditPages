I can't access external links or browse the internet, so I'm unable to view the Reddit thread you've shared about side hustles. 

However, I'd be happy to discuss side hustle topics with you! I could help you:
- Brainstorm legitimate side hustle ideas
- Discuss what makes a side hustle successful or challenging
- Talk about common pitfalls to avoid
- Explore different categories of side work (online, local, skill-based, etc.)

If you'd like to share some of the discussion points from that thread, I'd be glad to engage with them. Or if you have specific questions about side hustles in general, feel free to ask!
